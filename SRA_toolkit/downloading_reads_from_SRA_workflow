 #Install or load sratoolkit v2.9.1 or higher, I used 2.9.6
 Option 1:
 **fasterq-dump --skip-technical SRR7535523 -e 8**
 
 Option 2:
 fasterq-dump --skip-technical SRR7535523 -e 8 -O /scratch/user/My_download/
 
 #Files should begin downloading immediately. The time varies A LOT by the number of reads you are downloading.
 #--skip-technical = Technical reads (if present) will be removed. 
 #-e = number of threads to use
 #-O = Output directory to be created by program and filled with final output files
 
 #Option 2 will write the temporary files to the directory from which the command is run. For some larger SRA files it is necessary that the program runs in a separate storage device than where the final output files are written.
 #Use Option 1, unless it doesn't work (it will say it's running out of I/O), then switch to option 2.
