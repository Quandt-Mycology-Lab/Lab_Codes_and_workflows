 #You may need to run this command first to stop your home directory from filling with temporary files: #stop home directory from filling up with temp files
```
echo '/repository/user/main/public/root = "/scratch/summit/$user/sra-cache"' > ~/.ncbi/user-settings.mkfg'
```
 Option 1:#stop home directory from filling up with temp files
echo '/repository/user/main/public/root = "/scratch/summit/chjo1591/sra-cache"' > ~/.ncbi/user-settings.mkfg
/projects/caqu8258/software/build/sratoolkit.2.11.0-ubuntu64/bin/fasterq-dump.2.11.0 --skip-technical SRR7535523 -e 8
 
 Option 2:
/projects/caqu8258/software/build/sratoolkit.2.11.0-ubuntu64/bin/fasterq-dump.2.11.0 --skip-technical SRR7535523 -e 8 -O /scratch/user/My_download/
 
 #Files should begin downloading immediately. The time varies A LOT by the number of reads you are downloading.
 #--skip-technical = Technical reads (if present) will be removed. 
 #-e = number of threads to use
 #-O = Output directory to be created by program and filled with final output files
 
 #Option 2 will write the temporary files to the directory from which the command is run. For some larger SRA files it is necessary that the program runs in a separate storage device than where the final output files are written.
 #Use Option 1, unless it doesn't work (it will say it's running out of I/O), then switch to Option 2.
