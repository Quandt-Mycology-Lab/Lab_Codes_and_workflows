# 1. Run Proteinortho:

#Load funannotate environment. 

source ~/.funrc

proteinortho 

#This analysis only had 18 taxa and I used 8 cores. It finished in 15 minutes.

# 2. Reformat output to capture only results of single copy orthogroups. 

grep $'^N\tN' yourname.proteinortho.tsv > single_copy_proteinortho.tsv

# Where N = the number of genomes in your analysis.

# 3. Extract said proteins from the individual fasta files. #This STILL isn't working for me and I don't know why#

proteinortho_grab_proteins.pl -tofiles single_copy_proteinortho.tsv fastas/*.fas

#Notes: This script will only be available to you if you have loaded the funannotate environment.
#       This is assuming all the fasta files that went into your proteinortho analysis are in a directory called "fastas",
#       AND it assumes that all your input fastas end in the extension ".fas". 
#       If you didn't do this before the analysis, change all fasta names to have the same suffix.
#       This takes forever, but I ran it on the command line. For bigger (~50-100 genome analyses) should make a slurm.

#Your output should be individual files equal to the number of single copy orthogroups. They are named like this:

OrthoGroup##.fas

#You are now ready to move on to alignment and other steps of Tree Construction.
