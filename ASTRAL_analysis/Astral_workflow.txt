1. Prepare individual gene trees
#For input into ASTRAL, all genes used in a concatenated phylogenetic analysis need to be run individually through RAxML or whatever tree recon program you're using.
 
#You must rename all the fasta headers to be exactly the same across the alignments prior to runnign RAxML
#To do this to all of your input alignments, run:

for filename in *.trim
do
    cat "${filename}" | awk -F "|" '{print $1}' > "${filename}.renamed"
done

2. Run RAxML on all renamed gene trees
#Use the Load balancer to run all of these jobs.
