1. Create your individual gene trees
#For input into ASTRAL, all genes used in a concatenated phylogenetic analysis need to be run individually through RAxML or whatever tree recon program you're using.
#Use the Load balancer to run all of these jobs. 
#NOTE: some characters left in some of the gene names could trip up RAxML. For example ' and ] may need to be removed and then raxml can be re-run. 
For example:
cat original_OG55.fasta.out.trim | sed -e "s/'//g" > New_OG55.fasta.out.trim
